# Anomaly Detection

Hi! This is a project I built for my end of year CS project.

## Why

So one day I was bored and I came across opendata toronto, and they have 400+ datasets for a bunch of different things in the city (eg mobility, climate change, and misc stuff). I wanted to build something with one of these data sets, so I decided to build an Anomaly Detection program to detect if the average speed of vehicles in school zones go over the legal limit.

## Running

Install the deps

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Run streamlit

```
./run
```

After this it should open your browser with a user interface
